* It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.

* It is loaded inside the window

* The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)

* Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title

* We can access the document from a window using the window. document

* syntax:

* Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

* We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window

* The window is part of BOM, not DOM
